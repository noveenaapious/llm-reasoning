              "\n",
              "* **Oncogenes:** These are mutated versions of normal genes (proto-oncogenes) that promote cell growth and division.  When mutated or overexpressed, they act like a gas pedal stuck down, leading to uncontrolled cell proliferation – a hallmark of cancer.  Examples relevant to breast cancer include:\n",
              "    * **ERBB2 (HER2):**  Overexpression or amplification of this gene leads to excessive cell growth signaling.  HER2-positive breast cancers are a specific subtype.\n",
              "    * **MYC:**  Involved in cell cycle regulation and apoptosis (programmed cell death).  Its dysregulation contributes to uncontrolled growth.\n",
              "    * **PIK3CA:**  Encodes a protein involved in cell signaling pathways that regulate growth and survival. Mutations can lead to constitutive activation, promoting cancer.\n",
              "    * **KRAS:** While less frequently mutated in breast cancer compared to other cancers (like colon cancer), KRAS mutations can still contribute to tumorigenesis.\n",
              "\n",
              "* **Tumor Suppressor Genes:** These genes normally act as brakes on cell growth, repairing DNA damage, or initiating apoptosis.  Mutations or inactivation of these genes remove the brakes, allowing uncontrolled cell growth.  Examples relevant to breast cancer include:\n",
              "    * **TP53:**  A crucial gene involved in DNA repair and apoptosis.  Mutations in TP53 are very common in many cancers, including breast cancer, and are associated with aggressive disease.\n",
              "    * **BRCA1 and BRCA2:**  These genes are involved in DNA repair.  Germline mutations (inherited from parents) in these genes significantly increase the risk of breast cancer (and ovarian cancer).  They are associated with a higher risk of aggressive, triple-negative breast cancer.\n",
              "    * **PTEN:**  Involved in cell growth regulation and DNA repair.  Mutations can lead to increased cell growth and survival.\n",

Genetic testing can help identify these alterations to guide personalized treatment strategies.\n"
